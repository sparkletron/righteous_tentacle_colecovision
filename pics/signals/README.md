# SIGNALS INFO

## Folders
- Analog
All signals in the analog folder are measured using an oscilliscope probe, and include analog AND digitial signals self triggered as a single measurment.

- Digital
All signals in the digital folder are measured using a logic analyizer, and ONLY include digital signals.

## Usage
These captures are only for quick troubleshooting of the device. They are not perfect, though they give a rough idea of what someone should see. If they don't have something similar, there maybe a problem with signal.
