## Intro

  This recreation of the PCB is for documenation, and reproduction purposes. This mimicks the PCB of the original NTSC revision F main board.

## SOURCES
### Schematic Check
  - Atari HQ Schematic : https://wiki.console5.com/wiki/Colecovision : Dan Boris
  - Atari Age : https://forums.atariage.com/topic/285656-new-colecovision-schematics/ : ChildOfCV

  Special thanks to ChildOfCV. Using his as a check for mine after buzzing out my own board was a great help. His schematic on
  its own is a great resource.

  Did find a few issues with mine vs the ChildOfCV version, my board is a different revision so they will differ in subtle ways.
  Seems to be mostly just cap and resistor values in the RF circuit. Though I did adjust my values on the clock to reflect those
  recommend in the tech manual.

  The Dan Boris schematic is ok, has a few mistakes that I can't recall at the moment. Mentioning it since I did look at it, but
  due to its issues I didn't use it.

## REQUIREMENTS
  - KiCAD v6.X

## BUILD TIPS
  This design is made so anyone can build this. You may send it out to a fab house, you may use a PCB mill, or even etch it.
  This is possible since the components can serve as the plated through hole. Other holes can simply have a solid piece of
  wire inserted and soldered to complete the connection (excess resistor leads is a great option).

  Recommend soldering the cartridge connector first, the CPU makes soldering one side of the pins a bit difficult to do
  without melting the connector.

  There are various questionable routings, these are how the original is done. Some adjustments were made to make some things easier
  for at home builders without plated through holes.
