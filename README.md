## RELEASE VERSIONS
### Current
  - DEV

### Past
  - None

## PROCESS IDEAS
  - FIRST: Reverse engineer without outside resources. Only a internal reverse engineering of the board for the schematic.
  - SECOND: Use outside schematic resources to check, then verify those against the board to see who was right.
  - THIRD: Create a PCB based upon the orignal, make it close but not exact.

## SOURCES
### Schematic Check
  - Atari HQ Schematic : https://wiki.console5.com/wiki/Colecovision : Dan Boris
  - Atari Age : https://forums.atariage.com/topic/285656-new-colecovision-schematics/ : ChildOfCV

  Did find a few issues with mine vs the ChildOfCV version, though my board is a different revision.
  All mistakes were in the RF Stage on my schematic. Special thanks to ChildOfCV, having a source to check
  against that is as good as his really helped my project.

  The Dan Boris schematic is ok, has a few mistakes that I can't recall at the moment. Though the ChildOfCV
  is the superior rendition.
